# Build a model using formulaic-contrasts

## Use as base class / mixin

The most straightforward way of using `formulaic-contrasts` with a model is to use {class}`~formulaic_contrasts.FormulaicContrasts`
as a base class or mixin class.

Let's consider the following example wrapping an Ordinary Least Squars linear model for the use with `formulaic-contrasts`.

## Use as attribute

## Use it "by hand" only to introspect factor metadata (without .cond())

# Build contrasts
